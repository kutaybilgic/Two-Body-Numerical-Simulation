# Two-Body-Numerical-Simulation
 CENG216 Interdisciplinary Homework

python version 3.8.1
python libraries pygame (must be downloaded)

to start simulation run two_body_animation.py and give necessary inputs

Input example:
the time step : 0.15
the tlast : 100
the mass ratio : 0.5
the eccentricity = 0.7

when simulation is running
- press p for pause/unpause
- press r for rewind
- press e for exit

in coordinates.txt lines are separated by commas and every line there are 4 coordinates that are
planet1_x, planet1_y, planet2_x, planet2_y
